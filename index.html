By working alongside experienced professionals, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities and learn industry best practices. This hands-on experience will be crucial in transforming me into a proficient developer capable of creating smooth, user-friendly web applications.

                                Alongside my professional aspirations, I'm committed to making a positive impact on the educational landscape of my country. I envision leveraging artificial intelligence to create a free, accessible learning platform that will revolutionize how students engage with academic content. While existing platforms like Brilliant offer excellent resources, they often come with financial barriers. My goal is to develop a solution that breaks down these barriers, providing high-quality, interactive learning experiences to all students, regardless of their economic background. By combining cutting-edge technology with a passion for education, I hope to empower the next generation of learners and contribute to the overall advancement of our educational system.
