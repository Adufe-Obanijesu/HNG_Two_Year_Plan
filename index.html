                </div>

                <p>
                  In the coming two years, I'm determined to land a job as a
                  frontend software engineer. My objective is to join a company
                  where I can contribute to real-world projects and grow as a
                  developer. By working alongside experienced professionals, I
                  aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities and learn industry
                  best practices. This hands-on experience will be crucial in
                  transforming me into a proficient developer capable of
                  creating smooth, user-friendly web applications. I'm excited
                  to face the challenges that come with professional development
                  and to see my code deployed in production environments.

                  <h3>My Vision for Free Tech Education</h3>
                </div>

                <p>
                  Alongside my professional aspirations, I'm committed to making
                  a positive impact on the educational landscape of my country.
                  I envision leveraging artificial intelligence to create a
                  free, accessible learning platform that will revolutionize how
                  students engage with academic content. While existing
                  platforms like Brilliant offer excellent resources, they often
                  come with financial barriers. My goal is to develop a solution
                  that breaks down these barriers, providing high-quality,
                  interactive learning experiences to all students, regardless
                  of their economic background. By combining cutting-edge
                  technology with a passion for education, I hope to empower the
                  next generation of learners and contribute to the overall
                  advancement of our educational system.
